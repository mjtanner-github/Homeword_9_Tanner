## Description
The application enables the user to quickly produce README documents that conform closely to industry standards.

## Motivation 
The application is intended to guide the user, using npm model inquirer prompts, to draft a README document conforming to industry standards while automating many formating tasks so that the user may more closely focus on the content.

## Installation
Prior to running 'README Generator', the npm packages 'inquirer' and 'fs' must be installed in the Node directory. Then 'README Generator' can be run from it's resident directory with a call to Node.

## Usage
Simply follow the prompts and focus on content. Input type prompts expect text from the command line. Enter with no text input to cancel. Editor prompt open your default editor for input. Elect to save upon exiting. Exit without entering text or saving to cancel. After the final prompt is resolved, the README.md file will be created in the local director.
